# Adventure Works Bike Shop Power BI Project

## Overview:
The Adventure Works Bike Shop Power BI project spans three years of data from 2020 to 2022. The dataset comprises multiple tables, including product details, sales details, customer details, time series data, and information on continents and territories where bike shops operate. The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive visualization dashboard focusing on product details, customer details, territory specifics, and trends related to total orders, total revenue, and total profit per month.

## Installation:
### Power BI Backend:

#### Load the provided CSV-
format data files into Power BI using Power Query Editor for data cleaning and analysis operations.
Perform data cleaning, add necessary columns, conduct column profiling, and ensure column quality.

#### Power BI Frontend:
Move the cleaned data to Power BI Desktop, which consists of three main tabs: Report View for visualization, Data View for detailed data tables, and Model View for data modeling.

#### Data Modeling:
Focus on data normalization to enhance data integrity and reduce redundancy.
Define dimensional and fact tables, followed by DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) operations.

#### DAX Operations:
Utilize DAX to create calculated columns and measures critical for revealing significant insights from the data.

### Usage:

#### Report Building:
Create a comprehensive report with four pages.
- Page 1: General visualizations, including KPIs for total orders, revenue, profit, and returns, represented through line charts with time parameters (per month, per year, per week).
- Page 2: Map visualization for territory-based insights.
- Page 3 and 4: Detailed product and customer analysis using KPIs, bar charts, line charts, and area charts.

#### Customization:
Enhance report customization with page-level and report-level filters.
Incorporate buttons, bookmarks, and drill-through filters for a seamless user experience.

#### Security Rules:
Establish rules for report access and editing privileges, ensuring controlled and secure usage.
